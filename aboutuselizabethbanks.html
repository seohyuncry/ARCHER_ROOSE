                    pull a Sauvignon Blanc out of there? And Marian is making 
                    my dreams come true!”</p>

                    <h2>A perfect pairing</h2>
                    <p>Initially attracted to the brand through her love of wine, 
                        Elizabeth Banks stands by Archer Roose’s mission to make 
                        high-quality wine accessible to modern wine drinkers with 
                        formats to fit their lifestyle. </p>
                    <p>Both Elizabeth Banks and Co-Founder Marian Leitner-
                        Waldman are leaders in their industries, share similar values 
                        and are partnering together to elevate diversity and empower 
                        women in the beverage industry. They continue to challenge 
                        the status quo by creating a product that disrupts how wine 
                        is made and packaged, but also how it’s marketed - with 
                        humor.</p>

                        <p>Elizabeth appreciates Archer Rose Bubbley's environmentally 
                            conscious form of wine in cans. Why don't you relax and enjoy 
                            wine in a can like Archer Rose instead of a wine bottle that's too 
                            long and noisy? Archer Rose actively recommends it to those who 
                            simply want to enjoy alcohol.</p>

                        <p>Elizabeth brings us all a taste of gorgeous white wine. Enjoy our 
                            pinot grigio with a subtle taste of grapes. And besides that, there 
                            are bubbly, bubbly rose, rose, savignon blanc, malbec, so meet 
                            Archer Rose more colorful!</p>

                        <h3>03</h3>
                        <p>Elizabeth would describe the taste of a great Malbec poetically. 
                            "Try it, it's very delicious." In addition, five other Archer Rose 
                            alcoholic beverages are also confidently and confidently 
                            recommended to customers that they are very delicious. If you 
                            eat it, customers will probably describe it as a poetic evaluation.</p>
