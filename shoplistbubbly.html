                        <p>Grapes are de-stemmed and softly pressed. Then, the juice is 
                            chilled to allow sediment to naturally separate, and natural 
                            yeasts are added to initiate fermentation. Bubbly undergoes 
                            two different fermentations: the first in stainless steel tanks for 
                            approximately 15 days at 19- 20° C, and the second — which 
                            produces bubbles — for about 3 days.</p>

            <h2>Winemaker & Place</h2>
            <p>Stefano Nandi Wine Director at Montelvini Group. Born in Montebelluna, just a few Km from Montelvini, on the 
                11/11/1969, Stefano has always been passionate about wine, as most people are, in this rich and historical area for 
                wine production. After graduating from the prestigious “Cerletti” Oneology Wine institute in Conegliano, he 
                immediately started his career in the wine business, and after a few experiences, he settled in at Montelvini where 
                he now has been working as Wine Director almost 30 years. His passion and commitment towards Montelvini, 
                have made the winery what it is today. His vast experience allows themus to lead the way with new trends, while 
                keeping their roots in the history of their family. </p>
            <p>The province of Treviso is flat and features an abundance of water and waterways. The climate is mild, while the 
                temperature ranges on average from 27ºF in January and February, with rare, sporadic snowfall, to 95ºF in July and 
                August. During ripening, the high difference in temperature between night and day gives the grapes excellent 
                aromatic properties. The average annual rainfall exceeds 35 inches, with peaks typically recorded in autumn, while 
                heavy storms are common in summer. The soil is mainly clayey, with several substrates of limestone and 
                occasionally rock fragments.</p>

                    <h2>Pairings</h2>
                    <p>We believe the best pairing for wine is whatever you already had planned. But, if you did 
                        want to explore wine pairings, Archer Roose Bubbly is a great complement to a lot of 
                        beautiful foods.</p>
                    <p>Pairing Pro Tip: chewy, sticky candy is perfect with Bubbly, as the acidity and bubbles 
                        work to un-stick your teeth. Candy charcuterie, anyone?</p>

                    <h2>Recipes</h2>
                    <p>Chef Adam Moore has been busy creating globally-inspired dishes which celebrate the 
                        regions we source our wines. Where to start with Italian-inspired recipes? Veneto, Italy 
                        (the birthplace of our Bubbly) is renowned for fresh seafood, street carts, and delicious
                         meats and cheeses. The latest recipe to feature Bubbly is a Parma Street Cart Pork 
                        Sandwich - a perfect balance of salty, zesty, crispy, crunchy.</p>
