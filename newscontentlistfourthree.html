                <h2>People: Elizabeth Banks discusses her 
                    involvement in Archer Roose at South 
                    Beach Wine & Food Festival</h2>
                <p>Elizabeth Banks, co-owner and Chief Creative Officer of Archer Roose, sat down with People Magazine at South 
                    Beach Wine & Food Festival to talk about how she discovered the brand and what got her involved with 
                    Archer Roose. Here’s an excerpt: </p>
                <p>“So, very much we also felt like we were breaking down a real barrier as a female-founded company," she 
                    explains of Archer Roose, which was co-founded by the company's CEO Marian Leitner-Waldman and her 
                    husband before Leitner-Waldman reached out to Banks to become involved in the brand. ‘I was floating down 
                    a river in an inner tube with a can in the water staying cold, and I was like — this is the greatest day of my life,’ 
                    Banks says of first trying Archer Roose wine.”</p>
