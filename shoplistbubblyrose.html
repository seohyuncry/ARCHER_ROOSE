                        <p>The Pinot Noir and Glera grapes are picked and fermented into 
                            wine separately to enhance the characteristics of their varieties
                            as much as possible, and the blend is only created during the 
                            secondary fermentation process. </p>

            <h2>Winemaker & Place</h2>
            <p>Stefano Nandi Wine Director at Montelvini Group. Born in Montebelluna, just a few Km from Montelvini, on the 
                11/11/1969, Stefano has always been passionate about wine, as most people are, in this rich and historical area for 
                wine production. After graduating from the prestigious “Cerletti” Oneology Wine institute in Conegliano, he 
                immediately started his career in the wine business, and after a few experiences, he settled in at Montelvini where 
                he now has been working as Wine Director almost 30 years. His passion and commitment towards Montelvini, 
                have made the winery what it is today. His vast experience allows themus to lead the way with new trends, while 
                keeping their roots in the history of their family. </p>
            <p>The province of Treviso is flat and features an abundance of water and waterways. The climate is mild, while the 
                temperature ranges on average from 27ºF in January and February, with rare, sporadic snowfall, to 95ºF in July and 
                August. During ripening, the high difference in temperature between night and day gives the grapes excellent 
                aromatic properties. The average annual rainfall exceeds 35 inches, with peaks typically recorded in autumn, while 
                heavy storms are common in summer. The soil is mainly clayey, with several substrates of limestone and 
                occasionally rock fragments.</p>

                    <h2>Pairings</h2>
                    <p>We believe the best wine pairings are those you enjoy most!  But, if you did want to 
                        explore some canned sparkling rosé wine pairings, Archer Roose Bubbly Rosé is 
                        remarkably versatile and goes with nearly everything — really — it’s one of our most 
                        food-friendly wines.</p>
                    <p>Pairing Pro Tip: chewy, sticky candy is perfect with Bubbly, as the acidity and bubbles 
                        work to un-stick your teeth. Candy charcuterie, anyone?</p>
