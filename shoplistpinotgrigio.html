                        <p>Following hand harvesting, the grapes were whole cluster 
                            pressed to ensure delicacy in this wine. The juice was cold 
                            settled and racked, before fermentation by native yeast 
                            ensued. Fermentation temperatures were maintained below 
                            72ºF, and persisted for 14 days before completion to dryness.</p>

            <h2>Winemaker & Place</h2>
            <p>Mario Zanusso produces charismatic wines that capture the sunny slopes of Friuli. Mario’s winemaking philosophy 
                is that the maximum expression of his wines lies in purity: all you can find is only what the grapes have given them. 
                For this reason, the entire process in the cellar must be carried out with absolute accuracy. Simplicity is never a 
                starting point, but rather the point of arrival: it is a research which, from pruning to bottling, feeds on cleanliness, 
                precision and definition. He has chosen steel tanks and vats made of cement - ancient, material and therefore 
                fascinating - which guarantees a lightness to the wines he produces and is the aim of his compelling obsession. </p>
            <p>Our Pinot Grigio vineyards are on calcareous-clayey soils in the best wine-growing areas of the Friuli plain, already 
                mapped at the time of Queen Maria Theresa of Austria through the classification of the Crus of the County of 
                Gorizia-Gradisca (1787).</p>

                    <p>We believe the best wine pairings are those you enjoy most! But, if you did want to explore 
                        some canned white wine pairings, we recommend trying Archer Roose Pinot Grigio as a 
                        refreshingly tart complement to light, summery foods.</p>

                    <h2>Recipes</h2>
                    <p>Chef Adam Moore has created a mouth-watering dish inspired by Friuli, renowned for its 
                        garlic, among other tasty foodie finds. These Cheesy Pancetta Garlic Bread Pull-Apart 
                        Rolls are soft and fluffy, stuffed full of pancetta, pesto, roasted red peppers and melted 
                        mozzarella cheese. Hot out of the oven, the bread is drizzled with a lemon-garlic and 
                        Archer Roose Pinot Grigio butter.</p>
